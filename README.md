sigag (시각) - Korean for "time"

Study efficiently with an interval timer and track studying habbits using Sigag. Study in 25 minute to 5 minute intervals or study in custom intervals. ~~Track how often you study, and other useful statistics in the statistics page. Sigag will be a free desktop program available for everyone to use.~~
